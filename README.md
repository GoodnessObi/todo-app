# todo-app
This is a simple to-do App that was built in 3 phases.
Version 1 features:
    - Take inputs
    - Add to list
Version 2 features:
    - Does not allow the additon of an empty input to be added to list
    - Has a delete button
    - Has a done button which strikes the item on the list
Version 3 features:
    - List can be saved on local strorage
    - The enter key can be used in place of the add button to add input to list

Looking forward to returnibg to this to incorporate React.
